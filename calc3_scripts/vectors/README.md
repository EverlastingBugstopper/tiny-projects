# Vector Scripts
This directory contains useful scripts for manipulating vectors and finding relationships between them.

## Usage
This was written for Python 3, and will not run properly on Python 2 without excluding the parentheticals from the print statements.
Download the directory, and run any of the files, and they will run, doing what the title of the file says they will do. Each file can be run as main, and each script within each file can be used by the others.
